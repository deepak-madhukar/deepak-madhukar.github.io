# Hi there! 👋

I'm Deepak Madhukar, a Software Engineer specializing in AI/ML.
I have a keen interest in contributing to open-source projects related to ML and data science.
Welcome to my GitHub profile!

## About Me 🚀

* 💻 I'm currently working as a **Software Engineer - AI/ML** at **Orange Business Services**, where I design, build, and deploy enterprise-grade AI, Generative AI, and MLOps systems on GCP and Azure.
* 🔭 My core focus is on building scalable, production-ready models. I have hands-on experience building **LLM-powered automation and retrieval pipelines** (RAG) using LangChain, LangGraph, and models like GPT, Llama, and Mistral.
* 🌱 I am passionate about establishing **Responsible AI frameworks**, including bias mitigation, prompt moderation, and explainability, to ensure Al operations are compliant and auditable.
* 📚 I enjoy reading research papers and have conducted comparative evaluations of closed- vs. open-source GenAI frameworks to define implementation strategies.

## Tech Stack 💻

Here's a snapshot of the technologies I work with:

* **Generative AI & NLP:** Large Language Models (LLM), GPT, Llama, Mistral, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), LangChain, LangGraph, Transformers, Prompt Engineering, BERT, SpaCy, NLTK
* **Machine Learning & Data:** Python, SQL, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, PyTorch, TensorFlow, XGBoost, Supervised/Unsupervised Learning, Deep Learning, Model Fine-Tuning (LORA, QLORA)
* **MLOps & Deployment:** MLOps, MLflow, Docker, Kubernetes, Kubeflow, CI/CD, Model Deployment, Monitoring & Versioning
* **Cloud & Big Data:** Azure, GCP, AWS, Spark, Hadoop, ETL, Data Lake, Data Warehouse
* **Computer Vision:** YOLO, OpenCV, CNN, Image Classification, Object Detection
* **Frameworks & Viz:** Flask, FastAPI, Django, Gradio, Streamlit, Tableau, Power BI, Matplotlib, Seaborn
* **Tools & Version Control:** Git, GitHub, Jupyter, VS Code, Pycharm

## Projects 🛠️

Here are some of the projects I've worked on, showcasing my skills in AI and MLOps:
* **PLM (Predictive Load Modeling):** Trained XGBoost-based forecasting models to predict server resource utilization, improving allocation by 15%.
* [**Crowd Estimation**](https://github.com/deepak-madhukar/crowd_estimation.git): A Smart solution based on CSRnet to estimate crowd count.
